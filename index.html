                    <p><strong>UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE</strong></p>
                    <p>First, my team and I crafted and sent out a survey on social media to ask about their experience with staying hydrated and drinking water. We recieved about 65 responses and found that many people have experienced symptoms of dehydration and believed that they were not properly hydrating throughout the day. In order to learn more, my team and I then created an interview plan with questions that would help us dive deeper into this trend and understand why it was occurring.</p>
                    <p>We found 8 people to interview about their experience with hydration with the requirements that they were a young adult (between 18-30 years old) who was concerned about their health. Semi-structured interviews revealed that many people are simply not motivated to drink water.</p>
