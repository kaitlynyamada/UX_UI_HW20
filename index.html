                    <p><strong>UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE</strong></p>
                    <p>First, my team and I crafted and sent out a survey on social media to ask about their experience with staying hydrated and drinking water. We recieved about 65 responses and found that many people have experienced symptoms of dehydration and believed that they were not properly hydrating throughout the day. In order to learn more, my team and I then created an interview plan with questions that would help us dive deeper into this trend and understand why it was occurring.</p>
                    <p>We found 8 people to interview about their experience with hydration with the requirements that they were a young adult (between 18-30 years old) who was concerned about their health. Semi-structured interviews revealed that many people are simply not motivated to drink water.</p>

                            We conducted tests on 5 different people. During each test, each person was asked to complete 4 tasks while narrating what they were doing and their thought process. These tasks included:

                        <p><strong>My Thoughts</strong></p>
                        <p>This project was an amazing opportunity to dive into the user research process with a team and be able to practice the many skills that I have learned throughout the course in the context of a team. Through the process, I was able to level up my UI design skills by working on various UI animations. 

                        Initially, we were very overly ambitious about what this app was going to be  and the features it would had. As we delved more into the project, we had to prioritize a few core insights from our user interviews for the product to address the users' most prominent pain points.

                        Another important thing that I learned from this project was to be open to feedback and criticism. I think that everyone had wonderful feedback for us when testing the app which was how we were able to make the second iteration so much better and I am very thankful for that!

                        Lastly, as this project came to a conclusion I realized that no design is perfect and although we iterated on the design based on feedback, if time allowed, more user tests and iterations could improve the app even more.</p>

                        <p><strong>Future Direction</strong></p>
                        <p>Due to constraints on time, we weren't able to add all the features we initially thought of. In the future, I would love to add more features and iterate on the project more to improve the user's experience. Some features that could be added are:
                            <ol>
                                <li>The ability to add different types of drinks (ex: soda,coffee, tea, alcohol, etc.) and have users see how that impacts their hydration levels.</li>
                                <li>The ability to challenge more than 1 person so it wouldn't be a 1v1 but a group of people all working to meet their daily hydration goals.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
